# GearShare
### GearShare is an e-commerce web application where buyers and sellers exchange digital media equipment. The inspiration actually came from my friend [Rohan](https://www.instagram.com/rohan.jpg/),  who's a multidisciplinary artist( Music Producer, 3D Animator, and Graphic Designer) created the idea. I was impressed with his motto of experimentation without long term commitment and developed a strong desire to bring it to life.
